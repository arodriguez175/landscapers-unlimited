                        <p>Landscapers Unlimited was founded in 1985 by Paul A. Morgan, a recent graduate of the Duke School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.  Since his first field botany class in the 9th grade to his botany classes as an undergraduate student at Moravian College with Dr. John Bevington, Mark realized he had a special connection to plants.  Rather than pursuing a career in forestry, Paul chose the more creatively rewarding path of landscaping.</p>

                        <p>Today, Landscapers Unlimited employs several college graduates from NC State and other fine institutions.  Each brings with them special talents and skills, yet they all have one thing in common.  In accordance with the philosophy of their founder, each staff member at Landscapers Unlimited is committed to providing their customers with a quality product and courteous service.</p>
